<h2 id="test-driven-development">Test-Driven Development</h2>
<p>Test driven development (TDD) is a philosophy whereby the developer creates code by writing the tests first. That is to say you write the tests before writing the associated code!</p>
<p>This is an iterative process whereby you write a test then write the minimum amount code to make the test pass. If a new feature is needed, another test is written and the code is expanded to meet this new use case. This continues until the code does what is needed.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we need to find where two or more time series overlap. The range of each time series is represented as a pair of numbers, which are the time the interval started and ended. The output is the largest range that they all include:</p>
<p><img src="fig/python-overlapping-ranges.svg" alt="Overlapping Ranges" /><br /> Most novice programmers would solve this problem like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a function <code>range_overlap</code>.</li>
<li>Call it interactively on two or three different inputs.</li>
<li>If it produces the wrong answer, fix the function and re-run that test.</li>
</ol>
<p>This clearly works — after all, thousands of scientists are doing it right now — but there’s a better way:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a short function for each test.</li>
<li>Write a <code>range_overlap</code> function that should pass those tests.</li>
<li>If <code>range_overlap</code> produces any wrong answers, fix it and re-run the test functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing the tests <em>before</em> writing the function they exercise is called <a href="reference.html#test-driven-development">test-driven development</a> (TDD). Its advocates believe it produces better code faster because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If people write tests after writing the thing to be tested, they are subject to confirmation bias, i.e., they subconsciously write tests to show that their code is correct, rather than to find errors.</li>
<li>Writing tests helps programmers figure out what the function is actually supposed to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are three test functions for <code>range_overlap</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>) ]) == (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>)
<span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">2.0</span>, <span class="fl">3.0</span>), (<span class="fl">2.0</span>, <span class="fl">4.0</span>) ]) == (<span class="fl">2.0</span>, <span class="fl">3.0</span>)
<span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">2.0</span>), (-<span class="fl">1.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>) ]) == (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>)</code></pre>
<pre class="error"><code>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-25-d8be150fbef6&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)
      2 assert range_overlap([ (2.0, 3.0), (2.0, 4.0) ]) == (2.0, 3.0)
      3 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 2.0), (-1.0, 1.0) ]) == (0.0, 1.0)

AssertionError:</code></pre>
<p>The error is actually reassuring: we haven’t written <code>range_overlap</code> yet, so if the tests passed, it would be a sign that someone else had and that we were accidentally using their function.</p>
<p>And as a bonus of writing these tests, we’ve implicitly defined what our input and output look like: we expect a list of pairs as input, and produce a single pair as output.</p>
<p>Something important is missing, though. We don’t have any tests for the case where the ranges don’t overlap at all:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">5.0</span>, <span class="fl">6.0</span>) ]) == ???</code></pre>
<p>What should <code>range_overlap</code> do in this case: fail with an error message, produce a special value like <code>(0.0, 0.0)</code> to signal that there’s no overlap, or something else? Any actual implementation of the function will do one of these things; writing the tests first helps us figure out which is best <em>before</em> we’re emotionally invested in whatever we happened to write before we realized there was an issue.</p>
<p>And what about this case?</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">1.0</span>, <span class="fl">2.0</span>) ]) == ???</code></pre>
<p>Do two segments that touch at their endpoints overlap or not? Mathematicians usually say “yes”, but engineers usually say “no”. The best answer is “whatever is most useful in the rest of our program”, but again, any actual implementation of <code>range_overlap</code> is going to do <em>something</em>, and whatever it is ought to be consistent with what it does when there’s no overlap at all.</p>
<p>Since we’re planning to use the range this function returns as the X axis in a time series chart, we decide that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>every overlap has to have non-zero width, and</li>
<li>we will return the special value <code>None</code> when there’s no overlap.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>None</code> is built into Python, and means “nothing here”. (Other languages often call the equivalent value <code>null</code> or <code>nil</code>). With that decision made, we can finish writing our last two tests:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">5.0</span>, <span class="fl">6.0</span>) ]) == <span class="ot">None</span>
<span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">1.0</span>, <span class="fl">2.0</span>) ]) == <span class="ot">None</span></code></pre>
<pre class="error"><code>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-26-d877ef460ba2&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (5.0, 6.0) ]) == None
      2 assert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0) ]) == None

AssertionError:</code></pre>
<p>Again, we get an error because we haven’t written our function, but we’re now ready to do so:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> range_overlap(ranges):
    <span class="co">&#39;&#39;&#39;Return common overlap among a set of [low, high] ranges.&#39;&#39;&#39;</span>
    lowest = <span class="fl">0.0</span>
    highest = <span class="fl">1.0</span>
    <span class="kw">for</span> (low, high) in ranges:
        lowest = <span class="dt">max</span>(lowest, low)
        highest = <span class="dt">min</span>(highest, high)
    <span class="kw">return</span> (lowest, highest)</code></pre>
<p>(Take a moment to think about why we use <code>max</code> to raise <code>lowest</code> and <code>min</code> to lower <code>highest</code>). We’d now like to re-run our tests, but they’re scattered across three different cells. To make running them easier, let’s put them all in a function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> test_range_overlap():
    <span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">5.0</span>, <span class="fl">6.0</span>) ]) == <span class="ot">None</span>
    <span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">1.0</span>, <span class="fl">2.0</span>) ]) == <span class="ot">None</span>
    <span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>) ]) == (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>)
    <span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">2.0</span>, <span class="fl">3.0</span>), (<span class="fl">2.0</span>, <span class="fl">4.0</span>) ]) == (<span class="fl">2.0</span>, <span class="fl">3.0</span>)
    <span class="kw">assert</span> range_overlap([ (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>), (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">2.0</span>), (-<span class="fl">1.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>) ]) == (<span class="fl">0.0</span>, <span class="fl">1.0</span>)</code></pre>
<p>We can now test <code>range_overlap</code> with a single function call:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">test_range_overlap()</code></pre>
<pre class="error"><code>---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AssertionError:</code></pre>
<p>The first of the tests that was supposed to produce <code>None</code> fails, so we know there’s something wrong with our function. What we <em>don’t</em> know, though, is whether the other four tests passed or failed, because Python halted the program as soon as it spotted the first error. Still, some information is better than none, and if we trace the behavior of the function with that input, we realize that we’re initializing <code>lowest</code> and <code>highest</code> to 0.0 and 1.0 respectively, regardless of the input values. This violates another important rule of programming: <em>always initialize from data</em>.</p>

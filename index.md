title: Software Testing

Our previous lessons have introduced the basic tools of programming;
what they have not done is show us how to tell whether a program is
getting the right answer, and how to tell if iti is *still* getting
the right answer as we make changes to it.

To achieve that,
we need to:

*   Write programs that check their own operation.
*   Write and run tests for widely-used functions.
*   Make sure we know what "correct" actually means.

The good news is, doing these things will speed up our programming,
not slow it down.
As in real carpentry --- the kind done with lumber --- the time saved
by measuring carefully before cutting a piece of wood is much greater
than the time that measuring takes.

> JFi:Update
> You need to download some files to follow this lesson:
>
> 1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `python-novice-inflammation`.
> 2. Download [python-novice-inflammation-data.zip](./python-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.
> 3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called `data`.
> 4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:
>
> ~~~ {.input}
> $ cd && cd Desktop/python-novice-inflammation/data
> ~~~

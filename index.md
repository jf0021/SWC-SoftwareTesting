title: Software Testing
---
Our previous lessons have introduced the basic tools of programming;
what they have not done is show us how to tell whether a program is
getting the right answer, and how to tell if iti is *still* getting
the right answer as we make changes to it.

To achieve that,
we need to:

*   Write programs that check their own operation.
*   Write and run tests for widely-used functions.
*   Make sure we know what "correct" actually means.

The good news is, doing these things will speed up our programming,
not slow it down.
As in real carpentry --- the kind done with lumber --- the time saved
by measuring carefully before cutting a piece of wood is much greater
than the time that measuring takes.
